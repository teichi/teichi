The TEICHI Framework - Bringing TEI Lite to Drupal
--------------------------------------------------


### Bringing TEI Lite to Drupal

The [TEICHI Framework](http://www.teichi.org/) is a modular tool for displaying documents encoded 
according to the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI Lite P5) 
as pages in a Drupal-based website. The framework's name brings together 
the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](http://www.tei-c.org/) and Computer-Human Interaction (CHI).

 
### Modules

The framework currently consists of four modules: 
TEI Content, TEI Download, TEI Imageviewer, and TEI Search. 
Together, these modules provide a means of easily displaying
documents encoded in TEI Lite online, of downloading them in
various forms for further use, of displaying corresponding,
high-resolution digital facsimiles, and of searching in the texts,
all inside Drupal's powerful and flexible environment. 
For more details, see the list of [features](http://www.teichi.org/features) and the [documentation](http://www.teichi.org/documentation).
